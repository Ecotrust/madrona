<h3>Geometry Clipping</h3>
<img src="{% static 'manipulators/clipping.gif' %}" width="369" height="88" />
<p>Your geometry has been clipped to match the study region boundaries. Portions not overlapping the study region, or overlapping land, have been removed.</p>
<p>This operation occurs each time you create a geometry. We also keep a copy of the lines you draw, so you will always have the un-clipped version for editing.</p>
