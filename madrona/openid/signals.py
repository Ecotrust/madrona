from django.dispatch import Signal

# RDH 2023-06-07: This may be hacky since I don't know offhand what signal is used for
# but in reviving ForestPlanner I just needed this to compile. So I did this below:
# https://stackoverflow.com/a/70505629/706797

# a new user has been registered
# oid_register = Signal(providing_args=['openid'])
# oid_register = Signal('openid')
oid_register = Signal()

# a new openid has been associated
# oid_associate = Signal(providing_args=["user", "openid"])
# oid_associate = Signal("user", "openid")
oid_associate = Signal()
