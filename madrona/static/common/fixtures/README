This folder is for all files that may not be relevant to actual madrona
releases, but are useful for testing and planning. For example there could be
a kml file that represents the study region used for UI testing, but 
eventually such information would be created by a webservice. This would also 
be the place to put mockup images that are incorporated into the application
layout as a placeholder for planned functionality.
