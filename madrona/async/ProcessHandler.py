"""
NOTES:
    url entries should be unique -- a single url maps to a single task_id in a one-to-one fashion
    this strategy allows the asynchronous models to serve as a cache for those apps that wish to use it as such

    check_status_or_begin does not check to see if process is already complete
    if the caller wants the process to be run ONLY IF it hasn't been completed already,
    the caller should check process_is_complete instead

    process_is_running (called on its own or from check_status_or_begin or process_is_running_or_complete) checks
    only if status == 'STARTED', this seems like the safest strategy although it does have it's shortcomings.
    When a task is triggered, it is stored in the celery_taskmeta table with status == PENDING, as soon as
    a worker is assigned to that task, the status becomes STARTED, when the task is complete, status becomes SUCCESS.
    If something goes wrong during the STARTED phase (celeryd is shut down, etc), then status becomes FAILURE.
    If celeryd is not communicating with ghettoq, or not running at all, then the status will remain as PENDING.
    If we assume that PENDING means STARTED, then we may be mislead into thinking a task is being processed,
    when in fact it is sitting idle.  This may only become apparent after waiting way-too-long for the task
    to complete.
    If we only check for STARTED, then each time the task is requested, we will add a new task to the queue.  This
    may back up the queue, but only in situations when there is something wrong to begin with.  This will also
    likely alert the user (or the developer) more immediately that something has gone wrong with celeryd (or ghettoq,
    or whatever) since the returned statement will be something like 'the process has begun', even with subsequent
    requests which should have changed the statement to something like 'the process is already running'.  There is
    also the slight chance that a task will be requested in such quick succession that a worker will not yet be assigned
    to that task and the status will still be PENDING, in which case a new task will be added to the queue.  This seems
    a small price to pay for the more immediate recognition that there is indeed a problem.  As the developer in this
    case, I'd rather get the impression of a False Negative (thinking there may be a problem, when in fact there is none),
    than a False Positive (given the impression that everything is fine, when in fact there is a problem).  Also, the
    user is more likely to notice a problem sooner in the case when there is a hint in the returned statement (that
    the process has begun...yet again), than in the case when they must figure out there is a problem only because
    the process is taking an inordinately long time (in many cases this could mean hours rather than minutes).
